# Prefabs

This is where you should store 'prefab' scenes.

In Godot, there is no difference between a prefab and a scene. However, you can use scenes as prefabs, and it helps to organize scenes by how you plan to use them.

To spawn a prefab into a scene, simply drag the prefab into the scene. Note that you can only edit the root of the prefab instance, so it's a good idea to edit the prefab's scene whenever you want to make changes to it.
