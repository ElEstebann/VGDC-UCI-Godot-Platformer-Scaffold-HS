# Scenes

This is where scenes in your game should go.

Be sure to look at `example_scene.tscn` for an example of how you should set up your scene. You can start with a blank scene by editing `main_scene.tscn`. If you want to change the default scene, edit  
`Project > Project Settings > Application > Run > Main Scene`. 

For information on how to edit the tile sets, see `assets/tilesets/README.md`
