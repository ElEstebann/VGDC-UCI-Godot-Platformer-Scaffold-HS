# Tilesets

This is where tileset resources go.

To edit a tileset, double click on one of the tilesets in the FileSystem. This will open it in the inspector. You should see a `TileSet` menu open on the bottom of the screen. This is how you will be able to edit tiles.  
To create a new tile, click the plus (+) button on the bottom left of the menu, and select a texture to add as a tile. Once it's loaded, click on the texture you just added, then click `+ New Single Tile` on the top-left of the menu. Now select the region of the tile you want to add, and you're done! The new tile should appear when you want to use the tileset in a tilemap node.

To make a new tilset, look for the 'Create' button in the Inspector, and create a new Tileset resource. To save it, click on the floppy disk icon in the inspector, and save it to this directory.
